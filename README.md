# StatsAlgorithms

StatsAlgorithms.jl is a Julia package that implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch. This project is designed for those interested in understanding the inner workings of PCA and leveraging it for various data analysis tasks. The algorithms used are selected because of their ease of implementation and therefore it is better to use established libraries for larger data processing tasks.
